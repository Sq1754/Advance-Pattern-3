# Palindromic Pattern

This Java program generates a palindromic pattern based on the user input of the number of rows.

## Description

The `Q10_advance.java` program prompts the user to input the number of rows for the palindromic pattern. It then generates a pattern where each row contains numbers that form a palindrome sequence, with the center number being the row number itself.

## Pattern Example

For example, if the user inputs 4 as the number of rows, the program will generate the following pattern:

```
   1
  212
 32123
4321234

```
